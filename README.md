# short-link

## Description
short-link is a simple link shortener application developed with a primary focus on backend performance and architecture. The frontend is minimal and serves mainly to demonstrate the backend’s functionality.
The backend is implemented as a web server built using the Boost.Beast library for high-performance HTTP handling. To achieve efficient request processing, the server handles requests asynchronously and uses a connection pool to manage database access.
